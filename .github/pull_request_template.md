## ⚙️ Technical Checklist

Tick everything that applies. Leave non‑applicable items unchecked.

**AI / Application Logic**
- [ ] I tested story generation end‑to‑end with a valid `GROQ_API_KEY`.
- [ ] I verified that prompts, model names, and parameters are up to date with current Groq APIs.
- [ ] I confirmed that error states and empty responses are handled gracefully (no unhandled exceptions).

**Web3 / Smart Contracts**
- [ ] I verified contract logic on the **Monad Testnet** (deploy + basic flows).
- [ ] I ran the smart contract tests in `smart_contracts` and they passed.
- [ ] I checked for potential reentrancy / overflow / access‑control issues in new or edited contracts.

**Frontend / UX / Accessibility**
- [ ] My changes follow the **Progressive Disclosure** (accordion / step‑based) UX where applicable.
- [ ] I verified the UI in **light and dark mode**.
- [ ] I checked keyboard navigation and focus states for interactive elements I touched.
- [ ] I ensured accessible labels (`aria-*`, alt text) and semantic HTML for new UI.

**Backend / Database**
- [ ] I ran backend startup locally without runtime errors.
- [ ] I validated new API routes with both success and failure cases.
- [ ] I considered database performance (indexes, query filters) for any new queries.
- [ ] I confirmed that new logic respects existing retry/health‑check behavior where relevant.

**Security & Privacy**
- [ ] No API keys, private keys, secrets, or `.env` files are committed.
- [ ] I avoided logging sensitive data (tokens, secrets, full payloads with PII).
- [ ] I considered common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SSRF, injection) in my changes.

**Code Quality**
- [ ] I ran `npm run lint` (or equivalent) and resolved reported issues.
- [ ] I ran available tests for the areas I changed (frontend, backend, or contracts).
- [ ] I kept functions/components focused and avoided large “god” modules where possible.
- [ ] I updated or added types where necessary instead of using `any` by default.
