## Prerequisites

Before setting up the GroqTales development environment, ensure you have the following tools and
software installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher, including npm (Node Package Manager). Download from
  [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if not already installed. You can use `nvm` (Node Version
  Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions.
- **Yarn (Optional)**: An alternative to npm for dependency management. Install via
  `npm install -g yarn` or from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control. Install from
  [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) or your package manager.
- **Code Editor**: A text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or any editor with
  JavaScript/TypeScript support.
- **Cryptocurrency Wallet (Optional)**: For testing NFT minting features, install a wallet extension
  like MetaMask in your browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).
- **Truffle or Hardhat (Optional)**: For smart contract development and testing. Install via
  `npm install -g truffle` or follow
  [Hardhat's installation guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#installation) if you plan to
  work on blockchain components.

Verify your Node.js and npm/yarn versions with:

```bash
node -v  # Should output v16.x.x or higher
npm -v   # Should output a version number
yarn -v  # If using yarn, should output a version number
```

## Cloning the Repository

To start, clone the GroqTales repository to your local machine:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory where you want to store the
   project.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the GroqTales repository. Replace
   `yourusername` with the actual repository owner's username if different.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales.git
   cd GroqTales
   ```

3. **Switch to Development Branch (Optional)**: If there's a specific development branch, switch to
   it after cloning:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev  # or the relevant branch name
   ```

## Installing Dependencies

After cloning, install the required dependencies for the GroqTales project:

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**: If not already in the `GroqTales` folder, `cd` into it.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run one of the following commands based on your package manager:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

   This will download and install all necessary packages defined in `package.json`, including
   Next.js, React, and Web3 libraries.

If you encounter permission errors, ensure you have the necessary rights, or use `sudo` (on Unix
systems) with caution, or adjust folder permissions.

## Configuring Environment Variables

GroqTales uses environment variables to manage sensitive information and configuration settings. You
need to set these up before running the application:

1. **Copy Example File**: Duplicate the `.env.example` file to create your local configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Edit Environment Variables**: Open `.env.local` in a text editor and replace placeholder values
   with your actual credentials or mock values for development. **Do not commit `.env.local` to
   version control.** Key variables include:
   - **WalletConnect Project ID**: For wallet integrations (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONECT_PROJECT_ID`).
   - **API Keys**: For AI services like Groq (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY`), Stability AI
     (`NEXT_PUBLIC_STABILITY_AI_API_KEY`), and others.
   - **IPFS Credentials**: For decentralized storage via Pinata (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY`,
     `PINATA_API_SECRET`, `PINATA_JWT`).
   - **Blockchain Settings**: For Monad network interactions (`MONAD_RPC_URL`, `MINTER_PRIVATE_KEY`
     for test deployments).
   - **Build Mode**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_MODE=false` for local development to enable full
     functionality.

   Example snippet from `.env.local` (values are placeholders):

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONECT_PROJECT_ID=your_wallet_connect_project_id_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   MONAD_RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_MODE=false
   ```

3. **Obtain API Keys**: If you don't have the necessary keys:
   - Sign up at [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) for AI story generation API access.
   - Register at [WalletConnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) for a project ID.
   - Use test credentials or mock values for non-critical services during development.

Refer to the [Environment Variables](../Environment-Variables.md) guide for a full list and detailed
explanations.

## Running the Development Server

With dependencies installed and environment variables configured, you can start the local
development server:

1. **Start the Server**: Run the following command to launch the Next.js development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Access the Application**: Once the server starts (you'll see output like
   `ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000`), open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   You should see the GroqTales application running locally.

3. **Test Wallet Connection (Optional)**: For NFT minting features, ensure your browser wallet
   (e.g., MetaMask) is installed and set to the Monad Testnet (Chain ID: 10143). Click "Connect
   Wallet" in the app to test the integration.

The development server supports hot reloading, so changes to code will automatically refresh the
application in your browser.

## Testing Smart Contracts Locally

If you're contributing to or testing the blockchain components of GroqTales, you may need to deploy
and interact with smart contracts locally:

1. **Install Blockchain Tools**: Ensure Truffle or Hardhat is installed (see
   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).
2. **Local Blockchain (Optional)**: Set up a local blockchain environment like Ganache for testing:

   ```bash
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   ganache-cli --chainId 10143 --networkId 10143
   ```

   This simulates the Monad Testnet locally with Chain ID 10143.

3. **Deploy Contracts**: If smart contract code is available in the repository (e.g., in a
   `contracts` folder), deploy them using Truffle or Hardhat scripts. Check for a `deploy.js` or
   similar script:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   # or
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. **Update Configuration**: Update `.env.local` with local contract addresses outputted after
   deployment for the frontend to interact with them.
5. **Test Interactions**: Use the GroqTales frontend or scripts to test minting NFTs or other
   contract functions locally.

For Monad Testnet interactions, ensure your wallet is connected to the testnet RPC
(`https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz`) and has test tokens (obtainable from a faucet when available).

## Building for Production

If you want to test a production build locally or prepare for deployment:

1. **Build the Application**: Run the build command to create an optimized production version:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

   This generates a `.next` folder with compiled assets.

2. **Start Production Server**: Run the production server to test the build:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   Access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Environment for Production**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_MODE=false` in `.env.local` for full
   functionality, or set to `true` to mock database connections if testing without real data.

## Contributing Changes

After making changes or fixes in your local environment, contribute back to the project:

1. **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit your changes with meaningful messages following the
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format if possible:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new story generation endpoint"
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**: If not already on a feature branch, create one:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature
   ```

3. **Push Changes**: Push your branch to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-new-feature
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the GroqTales repository on GitHub, switch to your branch, and
   click "New Pull Request." Fill out the PR template with details of your changes. Follow the
   [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

Ensure your code passes linting and tests before submitting a PR:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
# or
yarn lint
yarn test
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Node.js Version Issues**: If you encounter errors like "unsupported engine," ensure you're using
  Node.js 16.x or higher. Use `nvm` to switch versions:

  ```bash
  nvm use 16
  ```

- **Dependency Installation Fails**: Clear the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` (or
  `yarn.lock`), then reinstall:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```

- **Environment Variables Missing**: If the app fails to start with errors about missing variables,
  ensure `.env.local` is correctly set up. Check logs for specific missing keys and add them with
  mock or real values.
- **Server Won't Start**: Verify no other process is using port 3000 (`lsof -i :3000` on Unix). Kill
  conflicting processes or change the port in `package.json` scripts.
- **Wallet Connection Fails**: Ensure MetaMask or your wallet extension is installed, unlocked, and
  set to Monad Testnet. Disable browser extensions that might interfere with Web3 connections.
- **Smart Contract Deployment Errors**: If deploying contracts locally fails, check for correct
  network settings in Truffle/Hardhat config and ensure your local blockchain (Ganache) is running.
