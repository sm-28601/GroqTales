## Architecture Notes

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js API routes handle authentication, story generation, and blockchain interactions.
- **Blockchain:** Monad SDK and Solidity smart contracts manage NFT minting and ownership.
- **AI:** Groq API powers story and comic generation.
- **Database:** MongoDB stores user data, stories, and metadata.
- **Testing:** Jest/React Testing Library for frontend; Hardhat/Foundry for smart contracts.

---

## Coding Guidelines

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Follow the Airbnb Style Guide.
- **React/Next.js:** Use functional components and hooks. Follow Next.js routing and data-fetching conventions.
- **Formatting:** Use Prettier (`npm run format`).
- **Linting:** Use ESLint (`npm run lint`).
- **Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages (Conventional Commits format preferred).
- **Docs:** Update docs and inline comments for all major changes.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository (do not branch from upstream directly).**
2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GroqTales.git
   cd GroqTales
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/IndieHub25/GroqTales.git
   ```
   
3. **Synchronize before starting work:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch (use descriptive, kebab or slash style):**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-story-generator
   ```

5. **Implement changes (small, atomic commits – use Conventional Commit style if possible).**
6. **Run quality gates locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm test
   ```

7. **Rebase onto upstream/main before opening PR:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

8. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/improve-story-generator
   ```

9. **Open a Pull Request:**
- Base: `IndieHub25/GroqTales` `main`
- Head: `your-username:feature/improve-story-generator`
- Fill out PR template completely
- Link issue with `Fixes #<number>` where applicable

10. **Address review feedback and keep branch rebased (avoid merge commits).**
11. **PR Merge Policy:** squash or rebase merges preferred; maintainers handle final merge.
12. **After merge:** sync your fork:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main
    ```

## CI & GitHub Actions
GroqTales uses GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and security.

- **Fork Behavior:** If you are contributing from a fork, some workflows (like Deployments) will not run. This is expected security behavior.
- **"Approve and Run":** Maintainers may need to approve your workflows if you are a first-time contributor. Note that automated PR comments (linting feedback, welcome messages) might not appear on fork PRs due to GitHub security restrictions. Please check the "Files changed" tab and the Actions logs for feedback.
- **Failures:** If a workflow fails with a "Resource not accessible by integration" error, it is likely a permission issue with your fork. A maintainer will review the logs.

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Write or update tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Frontend: Use Jest and React Testing Library.
- Smart Contracts: Use Hardhat or Foundry for Solidity tests.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
- If unsure how to test a feature, ask in your PR or on Discord.

---

## Labeling & Tagging
To ensure your contributions are tracked for **SWOC'26**, use the following labels:
* **Program:** `SWOC'26` (Mandatory for points)
* **Difficulty:** `SWOC-Level-1`, `SWOC-Level-2`, `SWOC-Level-3`
* **Area:** `frontend`, `backend`, `blockchain`, `AI/LLM`
* **Status:** `good first issue`, `help wanted`

---

## Documentation
- Update or add documentation for any new features or changes.
- Add inline comments for complex logic.
- Keep the [Wiki](https://github.com/IndieHub25/GroqTales/wiki) up to date for setup, usage, and architecture.

---

## Community & Support
- **Discord:** [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/JK29FZRm) for real-time help and collaboration.
- **Discussions:** Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/IndieHub25/GroqTales/discussions) for ideas and Q&A.
- **Security:** For vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
